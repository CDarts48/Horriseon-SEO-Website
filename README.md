I undertook this project in order to better understand semantics in HTML in order to create a more accessible web.
This project solves the problem of people over using the div symbol on pages and not providing proper semantics 
I learned that some built-in HTML commands should be used rather then using the div symbol becasue it make the web page more accessable 

##I received assistance from my tutor Corey Yates she showed me hot ctrl + D can be used to select and change multiple items on a page in VScode.
