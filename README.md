# Horriseon-SEO-Website
I undertook this project in order to better understand semantics in HTML in order to create a more accessible web.
This project solves the problem of people over <div>ing pages and not providing proper semantics 
I learned that some built in HTML commands should be used rather then <div> becasue it make the web page more accessable 

##Usage 

## I received assistance from my tutor Corey Yates she showed me hot ctrl + D can be used to select and change multiple items on a page in VScode.
